<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p align="justify"> This project is aimed at creating a smart home system that can control various devices in a house using internet connectivity. The system will allow the user to remotely control the lights, temperature, and appliances in their home, and receive real-time updates about their status.
 </p>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
Before getting started with the project, you will need the following:
#### Hardware
- A Raspberry Pi or any other IoT device that runs on Linux.
- ESP8266 Micro Controller for WiFi communication.
- Relays, transistors, or any other electronics components needed to control the devices in your home.
- A breadboard and jumpers for connecting the components.
- Devices you want to control (lights, temperature sensors, etc.).
#### Software
- Raspbian or any other supported Linux distribution installed on your Raspberry Pi.
- Basic understanding of programming in Python, C/C++.
#### Additional Requirements
- A router to create a wireless local area network, with an internet connection to connect your Raspberry Pi to the internet.
- An internet browser, Mobile applications to access the user interface of the smart home system.

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
