# ShiftDisplay
_by MiguelPynto_

Arduino library for driving 7-segment displays using shift registers

- Show numbers, text, and custom characters
- Use the whole display as one, or separate by individual sections
- Compatible with multiplexed drive and constant drive
- Compatible with common cathode and common anode
- Compatible with custom made and commercial display modules
- Maximum of 8 digits (for now)
- Concatenate multiple displays as one
- Only 3 pins used on Arduino

## Reference

### Constructors

* __ShiftDisplay()__

  * ShiftDisplay display([latchPin, clockPin, dataPin, ]displayType, displaySize[, displayDrive])
  * ShiftDisplay display([latchPin, clockPin, dataPin, ]displayType, sectionSizes[, displayDrive])
  * ShiftDisplay display([latchPin, clockPin, dataPin, ]displayType, displaySize, swappedShiftRegisters[, indexes])
  * ShiftDisplay display([latchPin, clockPin, dataPin, ]displayType, sectionSizes, swappedShiftRegisters[, indexes])

  Create a ShiftDisplay object, initialize the library using the interface pins, display properties and configurations.
  A display can be set as a whole, or divided by sections. Sections can be a logical separation (for example hours and minutes on a 4 digit clock display), or a physical separation (for example timer and score on a scoreboard with multiple displays).

  `latchPin`, `clockPin`, `dataPin` (int): number of the Arduino digital pins connected to the latch, clock and data pins of the shift registers;
  if is not specified, the default pins are 6 for latch, 7 for clock, and 5 for data.

  `displayType` (DisplayType): type of the display, can be common anode or common cathode.

  `displaySize` (int): quantity of digits on the display.

  `sectionSizes` (int[]): quantity of digits for each section, defined by each value in array;
  end array with a 0 or lower value.

  `displayDrive` (DisplayDrive): drive algorithm of the display, can be multiplexed drive or static drive;
  if is not specified, the default is `MULTIPLEXED_DRIVE`.

  `swappedShiftRegisters` (bool): when set to true, changes shift registers order to first being digit index controller, and second being segment controller;
  if is specified, displayDrive is forced to `MULTIPLEXED_DRIVE`.

  `indexes` (int[]): custom digit index order, each array position contains the index of where the digit is output from the shift register;
  if is not specified, the default is `{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 }`.

### Functions

* __set()__

  * display.set(number[, decimalPlaces][, leadingZeros][, alignment])
  * display.set(text[, alignment])

  array length must match display size.

  `decimalPlaces` (int): quantity of digits following the decimal point;
  the value is rounded according to this;
  if is set to 0, the decimal point will be removed;
  if is not specified, the default is 1 for real numbers and 0 for integer numbers.

  `leadingZeros` (bool): show or hide zeros on the left of value;
  if is not specified, the default is false.
