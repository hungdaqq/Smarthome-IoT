PlatformIO is an open-source ecosystem for IoT development that can be used within the Visual Studio Code (VSCode) editor. It provides a platform for developing, building, deploying, and managing software for microcontrollers and other embedded systems.

## Prerequisites

1. Visual Studio Code
2. The PlatformIO extension for Visual Studio Code

## Getting Started

To get started with PlatformIO in VSCode, you'll need to create a new project or open an existing one. Once you have a project open, you can use the PlatformIO commands within the `Project Tasks`. The basic steps are:
1. Initialize a new project or simply just open this `ESP8266` project.
2. Build the project.
3. Upload the project to your NodeMCU.


## Additional Resources

For more information on using PlatformIO in Visual Studio Code, please see the [official documentation](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/vscode.html). This includes information on using PlatformIO with different boards, libraries, and frameworks.
